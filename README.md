### What is an opinionated framework?
Most web frameworks for building full-stack websites or APIs/Microservices fall into one of two categories.
- Minimalist: Like express, these frameworks provide you the basic features to create a web server leaving it up to you to decide which libraries to use for connecting to databases, encryption, authentication, etc. and how to structure your files and folders in your workflow.
- Opinionated: These frameworks usually come with CLI tools that allow you to spin-up new projects with pre-defined projects structures, conventions and all the libraries for full functionality already built in.
